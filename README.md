# Atlas Messenger iOS

This repository contains the source code of Atlas Messenger, an example application built by [Layer](https://layer.com/) to showcase the capabilities of [Atlas](https://github.com/layerhq/Atlas-iOS), a library of robust communications user interface components integrated with the Layer platform.

#### For Demo Purposes Only

You may be tempted to directly integrate Atlas Messenger code straight into your app as a shortcut, but this is not recommended. Developers that have tried to directly integrate Atlas Messenger code into existing apps without fully understanding how Layer concepts work end up frustrated and confused. Three important things to note about Atlas Messenger:

1. Atlas Messenger uses an Layer identity server and token provider designed to only be used with this project. You must use your own identity server and token provider when building your own integration with Atlas. For more information, check out our [Authentication Guide](https://developer.layer.com/docs/ios/guides).
1. Atlas Messenger has a cap of only 20 users.
1. The Layer identity server does not work with production app ids.

If you're interested in learning more about how Atlas works and how best to incorporate it into your application then please read the [Atlas Documentation](https://developer.layer.com/docs/ios/atlas).

## Getting Started

Building Atlas Messenger requires that you obtain a Layer App ID. You can obtain an App ID by registering for a Layer account on the [Experience Atlas](https://developer.layer.com/dashboard/signup/atlas) page. Alternately, a pre-built version is available for immediate testing [at the same location](https://developer.layer.com/dashboard/signup/atlas).

### Building Atlas Messenger

To build Atlas Messenger, you need a few a few standard iOS Development Tools:

1. [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - Apple's suite of iOS and OS X development tools. Available on the [App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835).
2. [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) - The dependency manager for Cocoa projects. CocoaPods is used to automate the build and configuration of Atlas Messenger. Available by executing `$ sudo gem install cocoapods` in your terminal.

**NOTE:** At this time there is a known incompatibility with CocoaPods v0.36.0.beta.2. Please stick to v0.35.0 or v0.36.0.beta.1 instead.

#### Cloning & Preparing the Project

Once you have installed the prerequisites, you can proceed with cloning and configuring the project by executing the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/layerhq/Atlas-Messenger-iOS.git
$ cd Atlas-Messenger-iOS
$ pod install
```

These commands will clone Atlas Messenger from Github, configure the Atlas submodule in the `Libraries` sub-directory, and then install all library dependencies via CocoaPods. Once these steps have completed without error, you can open the workspace by executing:

```sh
$ open "Atlas Messenger.xcworkspace"
```

#### Setting the App ID

Before running Atlas Messenger from source code you must configure the Layer App ID. To do so, switch to the Project Navigator by selecting the **View** menu > **Navigators** > **Show Project Navigator** (or type `⌘1`) and expand the items **Atlas Messenger** and **Code**. Tap on `ATLMAppDelegate.m` to open the application delegate code and locate the following code near the top of the file:

```objc
// TODO: Configure a Layer appID from https://developer.layer.com/dashboard
static NSString *const ATLMLayerAppID = nil;
```

Replace the `nil` with the appID you previously obtained from the [Atlas build](https://developer.layer.com/dashboard/atlas/build) page. Be sure to enclose it in standard Objective-C string quotes (`@""`). Once configured your code should now look something like:

```objc
static NSString *const ATLMLayerAppID = @"035c3b96-ecb5-4642-b6b1-ff49ea2dd5db";
```
Note: The current Atlas Messenger project is designed to only work with a special `Atlas Messenger` project.  To create this special App ID you must go to the [Atlas build](https://developer.layer.com/dashboard/atlas/build)  page. If you use a different App ID you will see a "Request failed: forbidden" error when you launch the app.

You can now proceed with building and running Atlas Messenger. Select **Run** from the **Product** menu (or type `⌘R`). After the build completes, Atlas Messenger will launch launch in your iOS Simulator.

## Getting Oriented

Atlas Messenger was designed to strike a balance between being simple enough to quickly peruse the project, but full-featured enough to fully demonstrate the power of Atlas and Layer. As you begin working with the example code, keep the following things in mind:

* [Layer](https://layer.com/) is a hosted communications platform. All communications services leveraged by Atlas Messenger utilize the backend services hosted by Layer.
* [LayerKit](https://github.com/layerhq/releases-ios) is the native iOS SDK for accessing the Layer communications platform. LayerKit handles the networking, persistence, security and synchronization necessary to implement robust native messaging. LayerKit also presents a programming model for accessing the Conversations and Messages that are transmitted through Layer.
* [Atlas](https://atlas.layer.com/) is a library of user interface components developed by Layer that provide fully integrated user interface experiences on top of LayerKit. Atlas has a direct dependency on LayerKit and is not usable standalone.

When working with the Atlas Messenger codebase you will encounter code coming from LayerKit (prefixed by `LYR`), Atlas (prefixed by `ATL`), and Atlas Messenger itself (prefixed by `ATLM`).
